DNSSD-RELAY is a Multicast Discovery Proxy relay.  Multicast Discovery Proxy is a method for for
implementing multi-link DNS service discovery using mDNS on each link.

The relay proxy is an extremely lightweight mechanism for allowing a special Multicast Discovery
Proxy, called a Query Proxy, to act as a central DNSSD server for a site, using one or more
relay proxies to deliver mDNS queries to every link on which services may be present, and to
deliver mDNS multicast messages from those links to the Query Proxy.

The relay listens for mDNS multicasts on enabled interfaces and relays any such multicasts
unchanged to one or more DNSSD Query Proxies using unicast UDP over either IPv4 or IPv6.

The DNSSD Query Proxy establishes a TCP connection to the Relay Proxy.   Questions sent from
the Query Proxy are forwarded by the Relay Proxy to the link designated for each question.

Links are identified using UDP Ports: every network interface on the relay proxy host has a UDP
port assigned to it.  mDNS packets received on that interface are forwarded with that
interface's port number as the source port.  mDNS packets received from the Query Proxy are
multicast on the link corresponding to the port on which the packet was received.

The relay proxy listens on /tmp/relay-proxy-sock for control instructions.  A list of all the
supported instructions is given in the comment at the top of dnssd-relay.c.
