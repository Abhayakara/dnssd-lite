DNSSD-RELAY is a mDNS relay for implementing multi-link DNS service discovery
using mDNS as a service offer/enumerate/use transport.

The relay listens for mDNS multicasts on enabled interfaces and relays any such
multicasts unchanged to one or more DNSSD Query Proxies using unicast UDP over
either IPv4 or IPv6.

The relay also listens for unicast UDP requests from the DNSSD Query Proxy,
and forwards those requests to the link designated for each request.

Links are identified using UDP Ports: any given network interface on the
relay proxy has a UDP port assigned to it.   mDNS packets received on that
interface are forwarded with that interface's port number as the source
port.   mDNS packets received from the Query Proxy are multicast on the
link corresponding to the port on which the packet was received.

The relay proxy listens on /tmp/relay-proxy-sock for control instructions.
A list of all the supported instructions is given in the comment at the top
of dnssd-relay.c.
